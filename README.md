# AtCoderFriends

## Description

AtCoderFriends automates tasks about [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) programming contest such as:

- Download example input/output
- Generate source skeleton
- Run test cases
- Submit code

## Dependencies

- Ruby 2.3 or newer
- [Mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize)

## Installation

See [Development](#Develoment).

<!-- 
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'at_coder_friends'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install at_coder_friends 
-->

## Configuration

Create ```.at_coder_friends.yml``` and place it in the working directory (or parent of working directory).

```yaml
user: <user>
password: <password>
```

## Usage

### Setup

```
at_coder_friends setup     /path/to/contest
```

Creates contest folder, and generates example data and source skeletons into the folder.


### Run first test case

```
at_coder_friends test-one  /path/to/contest/source_file
```

### Run all test cases

```
at_coder_friends test-all  /path/to/contest/source_file
```

### Submit code

```
at_coder_friends submit    /path/to/contest/source_file
```

### Naming Convention

- Contest folder name will be used in the contest site URL.  
  For example, if ```arc001``` folder is specified, AtCoderFriends will use  ```arc001.contest.atcoder.jp```.
- Source file should be named ```[problem ID].[language specific extension]```(e.g. ```A.rb```),  
  in order to let AtCoderFriends find test cases or fill the submission form.
- Suffixes (start with underscore) may be added to the file name (e.g. ```A_v2.rb```),  
  so that you can try multiple codes for one problem.

### Notes

- Compilation is not supported.
- Source generator and test runner supports only ruby and C++.
